        <h1>Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookies</h1></center>
        <p>My grandfather was a professional candy-maker.  He traveled the fair circuit before I was born, making and selling fudge, divinity, and these cookies.
            By the time I was born he had long since retired - but in his workshop he kept the big copper pot, the marble slab for rolling the fudge, and all of
            his tools.  From time to time the extended family would get together and whip up a few batches of fudge the old-fashioned way - making forty to eighty
            pounds in one day.  It would then be distributed as gifts.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, making such large batches wasn't exactly convenient for day to day treats.  After much trial and tribulation, we were able to come up with a 
            stovetop variant of the peanut butter oatmeal cookies.  They were a holiday treat when I was a kid; we always left these specific cookies out for Santa 
            on Christmas Eve.
        </p>
        <p>It's a deceptively easy recipe!  Simple ingredients make whipping up a batch a snap...but the temperature and timing are very important to make sure 
            the cookies set up right.
